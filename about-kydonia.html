<p style="text-align: center;">Kydonia is a multi-server civilization focused on making people's lives better, while earning a nice profit. Bulk Mart has always and will always be the capital of Kydonia, soon there will be a Kydonian Server that will serve as the hub for all Kydonians, with a Giant Bulk Mart, and Spots for everyone else to build their own Bulk Marts. In order to help you understand, Let's start with the origins of Kydonia on Minecraft. It started on a private server with my friends, this is when I had also made my first Bulk Mart. Kydonia is a nation focused on making it's citizens happy, and being able to do basically anything, short of breaking the law. Kydonia currently spans 0 public server, but this is soon to change when we bring it to <a href="https://wynncraft.com/">Wynncraft</a> and soon, maybe, very slight chance of this, 2b2t.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Bulk Mart has been the capital of Kydonia since basically the beginning of Kydonia, It started on the server I had previously mentioned. It started as a small business venture by the lake, but then turned to a larger business a little further away up the lake. Pictured below is Bulk Mart on that server. Due to higher demand for certain items, like wood and fireworks, I had felt the need to turn Bulk Mart into a chain, as a lot of the server members have moved far enough from spawn to the point that it would take too long to get to Bulk Mart. The second Bulk Mart was build right outside someones nether portal to their farming district. The Bulk Mart was built in the nether so it would be easier to restock by not having to travel through too many portals. This was called Bulk Mart: Nether Edition. It only ever sold fish...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Kydonia's next big chapter in life begins when I decided I needed to sell another essential service to the community, but mostly towards the newer members of the server. I had started a housing division. Right outside Bulk Mart there started construction of two apartment buildings. One I believe is still unfinished, and one unsold.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/resources/bulkmart.png" alt="Bulk Mart" width="320" height="250" /> The OG Bulk Mart</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I now have new aspirations for Kydonia. Through the medium of Minecraft, and other games (mostly sandbox games) I hope to establish a world-wide presence in servers and games across the world, all united under the name of Kydonia.
